# CS50-Django-practices
This repository serves as a continuation of my previous repository, [Previous Repository(CS50W-Project0)](https://github.com/gabrielletirta/CS50W-Project0). In this new repository, I will continue to document my progress as I delve into the world of web development through the CS50 Web Programming course.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to record and track my daily progress as I advance through the course, particularly focusing on lecture 3: Django practice. This will include code updates, notes, and insights gained during the course.

## Daily records:
#18/09/2023 Day14: Watched video Lecture3:Django, until minutes 34. I learned on how to set up python and Django frameworks, routes.
